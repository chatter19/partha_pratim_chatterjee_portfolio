      <description>Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE ~ $ 11K) to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job. Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark. Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.</description>

      <description>EDI or Electronic Data Interchange is a standard for a p2p exchange of business documents.
In this project, I created a parser that extracts PHI data from unstructured industry standard EDi files and generates a structured data format to be consumed by the downstream data pipeline
The parser has the following capabilities:   Developed a custom utility to asynchronously read and parse millions of files using asyncio
  The parser is developed as a pluggable interface and can be integrated in any pipeline as a library</description>
